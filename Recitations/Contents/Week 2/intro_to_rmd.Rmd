# R Markdown

## Why R Markdown



# Headers, Lists and Basic Markdown Syntax

An R Markdown file is a plain-text file written in Markdown, which is a formatting syntax. We begin with section headers.


```{r eval = F}
# This is a first-level header

## This is a second-level header

### This is third-level header
```

Let's create a new second-level header (\#\#) in this section, and called it *Text Formatting*.

## Text Formatting

We will use bulleted and numbered lists to show some basic syntax to describe how to format text in the R Markdown

1. The following syntax are for plain text editing:
    * Make text italic like *this* or _this_. 
    - Make text bold like **this** or __this__.
    + Use backticks for code.
    * Wrap a character to subscript in tildes (~). For example, H~2~O renders as H~2~O.
    * Wrap a character to superscript in carets (^), like this: R^2^ renders as R^2^.


2. It's easy to link to websites and images using the following:
    - Direct in-line links such as <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>

    - Phrase links: R Markdown's [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

    - Embedding an image: ![Problem Solved](https://i.redd.it/ime0dq1q0kxa1.png){width=50%} 


3. Other stuffs:
    - You can create white space with this character: <br>

    - You can create a block quote like this: 
    
    > block quote

    - You can create a faint horizontal rule this way:
    
    ***

A table can be created like this (usually we don't do this by hand):

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell



# Code Chunks and In-line Code

## Code Chunks

## Running Code

## Control Code Chunk Options

The best way to learn chunk options is to try them as you need them in your reports, so donâ€™t worry about memorizing all of this now. Here are the key chunk options to learn:

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
# This is a code chunk you can play with different code chunk options


```


- `echo = FALSE`: Do not show code in the output, but run code and produce all outputs, plots, warnings and messages. The code chunk to generate a plot in the image below is an example of this.
- `eval = FALSE`: Show code, but do not evaluate it.
- `fig.show = "hide"`: Hide plots.
- `include = FALSE`: Run code, but suppress all output. This is helpful for setup code. You can see an example of this in the top code chunk of the image below.
- `message = FALSE`: Prevent packages from printing messages when they load. This also suppress messages generated by functions.
- `results = "hide"`: Hides printed output.
- `warning = FALSE`: Prevents packages and functions from displaying warnings.
