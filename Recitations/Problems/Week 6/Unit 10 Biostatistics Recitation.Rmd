## Problem 4

You decide to conduct a case-control study of your own to test if smoking status during pregnancy (1 = never, 2 = past, 3 = current) is associated with infant mortality (0 = did not die within one year of birth, 1 = died within one year of birth). 

## Problem 4a

- Should you use linear or logistic regression to answer this question? Explain your reasoning. 

\pause

  - \textcolor{red}{Binary outcome $\rightarrow$ Logistic regression}

## Problem 4b

```{r fig.align='center', out.height="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./stata_output.png",)
```
- What is the difference between the two outputs above and how are they related? 


## Problem 4b: Answer
    
  - The first output provides the \textcolor{red}{odds ratios} comparing the odds of infant mortality in each group with the odds of infant mortality among babies born to mothers who were never smokers at the time of pregnancy. 
  
  \pause
  
  - The second output provides the \textcolor{red}{coefficients} used in the regression equation.
  
  \pause
  
  - The odds ratios can be calculated by exponentiating the coefficients: $e^{\hat{\beta_2}} = \widehat{\text{OR}}_2$.
  
  - The coefficients can be calculated by taking the natural log of the odds ratios $\hat{\beta_2} = \ln(\widehat{\text{OR}}_2)$.
  
```{r echo = T}
exp(1.384814);log(2.284615)
```
  
## Problem 4c

Write the fitted regression model. Be sure to define your variables.

```{r fig.align='center', out.height="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./stata_output.png",)
```

## Problem 4c: Answer

- Model: $\text{logit}(\hat p) = \ln\left(\frac{\hat p}{1 - \hat p}\right) = -0.73 + 0.83x_2 + 1.38 x_3$

  - $x_2 = \begin{cases}1 \text{ if past smoker}\\ 0 \text{ otherwise}\end{cases}$
  
  - $x_3 = \begin{cases}1 \text{ if current smoker}\\ 0 \text{ otherwise}\end{cases}$
  
  - $p =$ the estimated probability of death within the first year of birth 
  

## Problem 4d

Based on what you know about the study, state which values of the first column in the Stata output (i.e. Odds Ratio/Coef.) are interpretable and interpret those values. 

```{r fig.align='center', out.height="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./stata_output.png",)
```


## Problem 4d: Answer

- Since this is a \textcolor{red}{case-control study}, we cannot estimate the probability or odds of the outcome, infant mortality. However, we can estimate the \textcolor{red}{odds ratio} for this outcome. Therefore, we \textcolor{red}{cannot} interpret the intercept (i.e. the value in the row for `_cons` in the Stata output), but we can interpret the slopes (i.e. the values in the rows for `smoking` in the Stata output). 

\pause

- Interpretation

  - $\widehat{OR}_2$: The estimated odds ratio comparing the odds of infant mortality among babies born to mothers who were past smokers during pregnancy is 2.28 times (or 128\% higher than) the odds of infant mortality among babies born to mothers who were never smokers during pregnancy. 


  - $\widehat{OR}_3$: The estimated odds ratio comparing the odds of infant mortality among babies born to mothers who were current smokers during pregnancy is 3.99 times (or 299\% higher than) the odds of infant mortality among babies born to mothers who were never smokers during pregnancy.
